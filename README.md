# PadOverlay

Touch gamepad overlay that injects controller input via Shizuku.

## Open and build
Android Studio / Code On the Go: open this folder, let Gradle sync, run on the phone.

## First-time setup (in the app)
1. Start Shizuku. 2. Tap 1 (overlay permission), 2 (Shizuku permission). 3. Tap 3 to start.

## MacroDroid (auto start/stop per app)
Action > Applications > Send Intent
- Intent type / Target: Broadcast Receiver
- Action: com.example.padoverlay.START   (or .STOP / .TOGGLE)
- Package: com.example.padoverlay
- Class: com.example.padoverlay.ControlReceiver

Triggers: Application Launched (game) -> START, Application Closed (game) -> STOP.

If the broadcast is blocked, use Target: Activity with class
com.example.padoverlay.ControlActivity and the same actions.

Also turn off battery optimization for PadOverlay (Android Settings > Apps).
Shizuku must be running (it needs restarting after a reboot).

## Game window (any phone)
In the app: pick the game, choose the window shape, tap "Launch game in window + start overlay".
Needs Shizuku, landscape, and the game fully closed. See NOTES.md for how it works and the
fallback idea (virtual display) if freeform does not work on a phone.

## Quick settings tile
Tap "Add quick setting tile" in the app (or edit Quick Settings and drag "Pad overlay" in).
The tile starts or stops the overlay using the current settings.
